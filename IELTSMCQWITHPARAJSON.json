    "TITLE": "Britain needs strong TV industry",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Comedy writer Armando Iannucci has called for an industry-wide defence of the BBC and British programme-makers. \"The Thick of It\" creator made his remarks in the annual MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival.\n\n\"It's more important than ever that we have more strong, popular channels... that act as beacons, drawing audiences to the best content,\" he said. Speaking earlier, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale rejected suggestions that he wanted to dismantle the BBC.\n\n'Champion supporters'\n\nIannucci co-wrote \"I'm Alan Partridge\", wrote the movie \"In the Loop\" and created and wrote the hit \"HBO\" and \"Sky Atlantic show Veep\". He delivered the 40th annual MacTaggart Lecture, which has previously been given by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, former BBC director general Greg Dyke, Jeremy Paxman and Rupert Murdoch. Iannucci said: \"Faced with a global audience, British television needs its champion supporters.\"\n\nHe continued his praise for British programming by saying the global success of American TV shows had come about because they were emulating British television. \"The best US shows are modelling themselves on what used to make British TV so world-beating,\" he said. \"US prime-time schedules are now littered with those quirky formats from the UK - the \"Who Do You Think You Are\"'s and the variants on \"Strictly Come Dancing\" - as well as the single-camera non-audience sitcom, which we brought into the mainstream first. We have changed international viewing for the better.\"\n\nWith the renewal of the BBC's royal charter approaching, Iannucci also praised the corporation. He said: \"If public service broadcasting - one of the best things we've ever done creatively as a country - if it was a car industry, our ministers would be out championing it overseas, trying to win contracts, boasting of the British jobs that would bring.\" In July, the government issued a green paper setting out issues that will be explored during negotiations over the future of the BBC, including the broadcaster's size, its funding and governance.\n\nPrimarily Mr Whittingdale wanted to appoint a panel of five people, but finally he invited two more people to advise on the channer renewal, namely former Channel 4 boss Dawn Airey and journalism professor Stewart Purvis, a former editor-in-chief of ITN. Iannucci bemoaned the lack of \"creatives\" involved in the discussions.\n\n\"When the media, communications and information industries make up nearly 8% our GDP, larger than the car and oil and gas industries put together, we need to be heard, as those industries are heard. But when I see the panel of experts who've been asked by the culture secretary to take a root and branch look at the BBC, I don't see anyone who is a part of that cast and crew list. I see executives, media owners, industry gurus, all talented people - but not a single person who's made a classic and enduring television show.\"\n\n'Don't be modest'\n\nIannucci suggested one way of easing the strain on the licence fee was \"by pushing ourselves more commercially abroad\".\n\n\"Use the BBC's name, one of the most recognised brands in the world,\" he said. \"And use the reputation of British television across all networks, to capitalise financially oversees. Be more aggressive in selling our shows, through advertising, through proper international subscription channels, freeing up BBC Worldwide to be fully commercial, whatever it takes.\n\n\"Frankly, don't be icky and modest about making money, let's monetise the bezeesus Mary and Joseph out of our programmes abroad so that money can come back, take some pressure off the licence fee at home and be invested in even more ambitious quality shows, that can only add to our value.\"\n\nMr Whittingdale, who was interviewed by ITV News' Alastair Stewart at the festival, said he wanted an open debate about whether the corporation should do everything it has done in the past.  He said he had a slight sense that people who rushed to defend the BBC were \"trying to have an argument that's never been started\".\n\n\"Whatever my view is, I don't determine what programmes the BBC should show,\" he added. \"That's the job of the BBC.\" Mr Whittingdale said any speculation that the Conservative Party had always wanted to change the BBC due to issues such as its editorial line was \"absolute nonsense\".",

    "TITLE": "As More Tech Start-Ups Stay Private, So Does the Money",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Not long ago, if you were a young, brash technologist with a world-conquering start-up idea, there was a good chance you spent much of your waking life working toward a single business milestone: taking your company public.\n\n  Though luminaries of the tech industry have always expressed skepticism and even hostility toward the finance industry, tech’s dirty secret was that it looked to Wall Street and the ritual of a public offering for affirmation — not to mention wealth.\n\n  But something strange has happened in the last couple of years: The initial public offering of stock has become déclassé. For start-up entrepreneurs and their employees across Silicon Valley, an initial public offering is no longer a main goal. Instead, many founders talk about going public as a necessary evil to be postponed as long as possible because it comes with more problems than benefits.\n\n  “If you can get $200 million from private sources, then yeah, I don’t want my company under the scrutiny of the unwashed masses who don’t understand my business,” said Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of Mattermark, a start-up that organizes and sells information about the start-up market. “That’s actually terrifying to me.\n\n  Silicon Valley’s sudden distaste for the I.P.O. — rooted in part in Wall Street’s skepticism of new tech stocks — may be the single most important psychological shift underlying the current tech boom. Staying private affords start-up executives the luxury of not worrying what outsiders think and helps them avoid the quarterly earnings treadmill.\n\n  It also means Wall Street is doing what it failed to do in the last tech boom: using traditional metrics like growth and profitability to price companies. Investors have been tough on Twitter, for example, because its user growth has slowed. They have been tough on Box, the cloud-storage company that went public last year, because it remains unprofitable. And the e-commerce company Zulily, which went public last year, was likewise punished when it cut its guidance for future sales.\n\n  Scott Kupor, the managing partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and his colleagues said in a recent report that despite all the attention start-ups have received in recent years, tech stocks are not seeing unusually high valuations. In fact, their share of the overall market has remained stable for 14 years, and far off the peak of the late 1990s.\n\n  That unwillingness to cut much slack to young tech companies limits risk for regular investors. If the bubble pops, the unwashed masses, if that’s what we are, aren’t as likely to get washed out.\n\n  Private investors, on the other hand, are making big bets on so-called unicorns — the Silicon Valley jargon for start-up companies valued at more than a billion dollars. If many of those unicorns flop, most Americans will escape unharmed, because losses will be confined to venture capitalists and hedge funds that have begun to buy into tech start-ups, as well as tech founders and their employees.\n\n  The reluctance — and sometimes inability — to go public is spurring the unicorns. By relying on private investors for a longer period of time, start-ups get more runway to figure out sustainable business models. To delay their entrance into the public markets, firms like Airbnb, Dropbox, Palantir, Pinterest, Uber and several other large start-ups are raising hundreds of millions, and in some cases billions, that they would otherwise have gained through an initial public offering.\n\n  “These companies are going public, just in the private market,” Dan Levitan, the managing partner of the venture capital firm Maveron, told me recently. He means that in many cases, hedge funds and other global investors that would have bought shares in these firms after an I.P.O. are deciding to go into late-stage private rounds. There is even an oxymoronic term for the act of obtaining private money in place of a public offering: It’s called a “private I.P.O.”\n\n  The delay in I.P.O.s has altered how some venture capital firms do business. Rather than waiting for an initial offering, Maveron, for instance, says it now sells its stake in a start-up to other, larger private investors once it has made about 100 times its initial investment. It is the sort of return that once was only possible after an I.P.O.\n\n  But there is also a downside to the new aversion to initial offerings. When the unicorns do eventually go public and begin to soar — or whatever it is that fantastical horned beasts tend to do when they’re healthy — the biggest winners will be the private investors that are now bearing most of the risk.\n\n  It used to be that public investors who got in on the ground floor of an initial offering could earn historic gains. If you invested $1,000 in Amazon at its I.P.O. in 1997, you would now have nearly $250,000. If you had invested $1,000 in Microsoft in 1986, you would have close to half a million. Public investors today are unlikely to get anywhere near such gains from tech I.P.O.s. By the time tech companies come to the market, the biggest gains have already been extracted by private backers.\n\n  Just 53 technology companies went public in 2014, which is around the median since 1980, but far fewer than during the boom of the late 1990s and 2000, when hundreds of tech companies went public annually, according to statistics maintained by Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida. Today’s companies are also waiting longer. In 2014, the typical tech company hitting the markets was 11 years old, compared with a median age of seven years for tech I.P.O.s since 1980.\n\n  Over the last few weeks, I’ve asked several founders and investors why they’re waiting; few were willing to speak on the record about their own companies, but their answers all amounted to “What’s the point?”\n\n  Initial public offerings were also ways to compensate employees and founders who owned lots of stock, but there are now novel mechanisms — such as selling shares on a secondary market — for insiders to cash in on some of their shares in private companies. Still, some observers cautioned that the new trend may be a bad deal for employees who aren’t given much information about the company’s performance.\n\n  “One thing employees may be confused about is when companies tell them, ‘We’re basically doing a private I.P.O.,’ it might make them feel like there’s less risk than there really is,” said Ms. Morrill of Mattermark. But she said it was hard to persuade people that their paper gains may never materialize. “The Kool-Aid is really strong,” she said.\n\n  If the delay in I.P.O.s becomes a normal condition for Silicon Valley, some observers say tech companies may need to consider new forms of compensation for workers. “We probably need to fundamentally rethink how do private companies compensate employees, because that’s going to be an issue,” said Mr. Kupor, of Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n  During a recent presentation for Andreessen Horowitz’s limited partners — the institutions that give money to the venture firm — Marc Andreessen, the firm’s co-founder, told the journalist Dan Primack that he had never seen a sharper divergence in how investors treat public- and private-company chief executives. “They tell the public C.E.O., ‘Give us the money back this quarter,’ and they tell the private C.E.O., ‘No problem, go for 10 years,’ ” Mr. Andreessen said.\n\n  At some point this tension will be resolved. “Private valuations will not forever be higher than public valuations,” said Mr. Levitan, of Maveron. “So the question is, Will private markets capitulate and go down or will public markets go up?”\n\n  If the private investors are wrong, employees, founders and a lot of hedge funds could be in for a reckoning. But if they’re right, it will be you and me wearing the frown — the public investors who missed out on the next big thing.",

    "TITLE": "The science of sleep",
    "PARAGRAPH": "We spend a third of our lives doing it. Napoleon, Florence Nightingale and Margaret Thatcher got by on four hours a night. Thomas Edison claimed it was waste of time.\n\n  So why do we sleep? This is a question that has baffled scientists for centuries and the answer is, no one is really sure. Some believe that sleep gives the body a chance to recuperate from the day's activities but in reality, the amount of energy saved by sleeping for even eight hours is miniscule - about 50 kCal, the same amount of energy in a piece of toast.\n\n  With continued lack of sufficient sleep, the part of the brain that controls language, memory, planning and sense of time is severely affected, practically shutting down. In fact, 17 hours of sustained wakefulness leads to a decrease in performance equivalent to a blood alcohol level of 0.05% (two glasses of wine). This is the legal drink driving limit in the UK.\n\n  Research also shows that sleep-deprived individuals often have difficulty in responding to rapidly changing situations and making rational judgements. In real life situations, the consequences are grave and lack of sleep is said to have been be a contributory factor to a number of international disasters such as Exxon Valdez, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and the Challenger shuttle explosion.\n\n  Sleep deprivation not only has a major impact on cognitive functioning but also on emotional and physical health. Disorders such as sleep apnoea which result in excessive daytime sleepiness have been linked to stress and high blood pressure. Research has also suggested that sleep loss may increase the risk of obesity because chemicals and hormones that play a key role in controlling appetite and weight gain are released during sleep.\n\n  What happens when we sleep?\n\n  What happens every time we get a bit of shut eye? Sleep occurs in a recurring cycle of 90 to 110 minutes and is divided into two categories: non-REM (which is further split into four stages) and REM sleep.\n\n  Non-REM sleep\n\n  Stage one: Light Sleep\n\n  During the first stage of sleep, we're half awake and half asleep. Our muscle activity slows down and slight twitching may occur. This is a period of light sleep, meaning we can be awakened easily at this stage.\n\n  Stage two: True Sleep\n\n  Within ten minutes of light sleep, we enter stage two, which lasts around 20 minutes. The breathing pattern and heart rate start to slow down. This period accounts for the largest part of human sleep.\n\n  Stages three and four: Deep Sleep\n\n  During stage three, the brain begins to produce delta waves, a type of wave that is large (high amplitude) and slow (low frequency). Breathing and heart rate are at their lowest levels.\n\n  Stage four is characterised by rhythmic breathing and limited muscle activity. If we are awakened during deep sleep we do not adjust immediately and often feel groggy and disoriented for several minutes after waking up. Some children experience bed-wetting, night terrors, or sleepwalking during this stage.\n\n  REM sleep\n\n  The first rapid eye movement (REM) period usually begins about 70 to 90 minutes after we fall asleep. We have around three to five REM episodes a night.\n\n  Although we are not conscious, the brain is very active - often more so than when we are awake. This is the period when most dreams occur. Our eyes dart around (hence the name), our breathing rate and blood pressure rise. However, our bodies are effectively paralysed, said to be nature's way of preventing us from acting out our dreams.\n\n  After REM sleep, the whole cycle begins again.\n\n  How much sleep is required?\n\n  There is no set amount of time that everyone needs to sleep, since it varies from person to person. Results from the sleep profiler indicate that people like to sleep anywhere between 5 and 11 hours, with the average being 7.75 hours.\n\n  Jim Horne from Loughborough University's Sleep Research Centre has a simple answer though: \"The amount of sleep we require is what we need not to be sleepy in the daytime.\"\n\n  Even animals require varied amounts of sleep:\n\nSpecies\n\nAverage total sleep time per day\n\nPython\n\n18 hrs\n\nTiger\n\n15.8 hrs\n\nCat\n\n12.1 hrs\n\nChimpanzee\n\n9.7 hrs\n\nSheep\n\n3.8 hrs\n\nAfrican elephant  \n\n3.3 hrs\n\nGiraffe\n\n1.9 hr\n\n  The current world record for the longest period without sleep is 11 days, set by Randy Gardner in 1965. Four days into the research, he began hallucinating. This was followed by a delusion where he thought he was a famous footballer. Surprisingly, Randy was actually functioning quite well at the end of his research and he could still beat the scientist at pinball.",

    "TITLE": "The potential to sniff out disease",
    "PARAGRAPH": "The fact diseases have a smell comes as no surprise - but finding someone or something that can detect them at an early stage could hold huge potential for medicine.\n\nBreath, bodily odours and urine are all amazingly revealing about general health. Even the humble cold can give off an odour, thanks to the thick bacteria-ridden mucus that ends up in the back of the throat. The signs are not apparent to everyone - but some super-smellers are very sensitive to the odours. Joy Milne, for example, noticed her husband's smell had changed shortly before he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\n\nHumans can detect nearly 10,000 different smells. Formed by chemicals in the air, they are absorbed by little hairs, made of extremely sensitive nerve fibres, hanging from the nose's olfactory receptors. And the human sense of smell is 10,000 times more sensitive than the sense of taste. But dogs, as the old joke might have had it, smell even better.\n\nTheir ability to detect four times as many odours as humans makes them a potential early warning system for a range of diseases. Research suggesting dogs' could sniff out cancers, for example, was first published about 10 years ago. And there have been many tales of dogs repeatedly sniffing an area of their owner's body, only for it to turn out to be hiding a tumour.\n\nWhat they are smelling are the \"volatile molecules\" given off by cells when they become cancerous. Some studies suggest dogs can be 93% accurate. Others suggest they can detect very small tumours before clinical tests can. And yet more studies have produced mixed results.\n\n \n\nDoes cancer smell?\n\nAt Milton Keynes University Hospital, a small team has recently begun to collect human urine samples to test dogs' ability to detect the smell of prostate cancer. The patients had symptoms such as difficulty urinating or a change in flow, which could turn out to be prostate, bladder or liver cancer.\n\nRowena Fletcher, head of research and development at the hospital, says the role of the dogs - which have been trained by Medical Detection Dogs - is to pick out samples that smell of cancer. Further down the line, a clinical test will show if the dogs' diagnosis is correct. She says the potential for using dogs in this way is far-reaching - even if it is not practical to have a dog in every surgery.\n\n\"We hope one day that there could be an electronic machine on every GP's desk which could test a urine sample for diseases by smelling it,\" she says. \"But first we need to pick up the pattern of what the dogs are smelling.\"\n\nAnd that's the key. Dogs can't tell us what their noses are detecting, but scientists believe that different cancers could produce different smells, although some might also be very similar.\n\n \n\nElectronic noses\n\nLab tests to understand what these highly-trained dogs are smelling could then inform the development of 'electronic noses' to detect the same molecules. These might then give rise to better diagnostic tests in the future. The potential for using smell to test for a wide range of diseases is huge, Ms Fletcher says.\n\nBacteria, cancers and chronic diseases could all have their own odour - which may be imperceptible to only the most sensitive humans, but obvious to dogs. It may be possible in the future to use disease odours as the basis for a national screening programme or to test everybody at risk of a certain cancer in a particular age group.\n\nHowever, there are fewer than 20 dogs in the UK trained to detect cancer at present. Training more will take more funding and time. On the positive side, all dogs are eligible to be trained provided they are keen on searching and hunting. Whatever their breed or size, it's our four-legged friend's astounding sense of smell which could unlock a whole new way of detecting human diseases.",

    "TITLE": "Penguins' anti-ice trick revealed",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Scientists studying penguins’ feathers have revealed how the birds stay ice free when hopping in and out of below zero waters in the Antarctic. A combination of nano-sized pores and an extra water repelling preening oil the birds secrete is thought to give Antarctic penguins’ feathers superhydrophobic properties. Researchers in the US made the discovery using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to study penguin feathers in extreme detail. Antarctic penguins live in one of Earth’s most extreme environments, facing temperatures that drop to -40C, winds with speeds of 40 metres per second and water that stays around -2.2C. But even in these sub-zero conditions, the birds manage to prevent ice from coating their feathers.\n\n“They are an amazing species, living in extreme conditions, and great swimmers. Basically they are living engineering marvels,” says research team member Dr Pirouz Kavehpour, professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Birds’ feathers are known to have hydrophobic, or non-wetting, properties. But scientists from UCLA, University of Massachusetts Amherst and SeaWorld, wanted to know what makes Antarctic penguins’ feathers extra ice repelling.\n\n“What we learn here is how penguins combine oil and nano-structures on the feathers to produce this effect to perfection,” explains Kavehpour. By analysing feathers from different penguin species, the researchers discovered Antarctic species the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) was more superhydrophobic compared with a species found in warmer climes – the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) – whose breeding sites include Argentinian desert.\n\nGentoo penguins’ feathers contained tiny pores which trapped air, making the surface hydrophobic. And they were smothered with a special preening oil, produced by a gland near the base of the tail, with which the birds cover themselves. Together, these properties mean that in the wild, droplets of water on Antarctic penguins’ superhydrophobic feathers bead up on the surface like spheres – formations that, according to the team, could provide geometry that delays ice formation, since heat cannot easily flow out of the water if the droplet only has minimal contact with the surface of the feather.\n\n“The shape of the droplet on the surface dictates the delay in freezing,” explains Kavehpour. The water droplets roll off the penguin's feathers before they have time to freeze, the researchers propose. Penguins living in the Antarctic are highly evolved to cope with harsh conditions: their short outer feathers overlap to make a thick protective layer over fluffier feathers which keep them warm. Under their skin, a thick layer of fat keeps them insulated. The flightless birds spend a lot of time in the sea and are extremely agile and graceful swimmers, appearing much more awkward on land.\n\nKavehpour was inspired to study Antarctic penguins’ feathers after watching the birds in a nature documentary: “I saw these birds moving in and out of water, splashing everywhere. Yet there is no single drop of frozen ice sticking to them,” he tells BBC Earth. His team now hopes its work could aid design of better man-made surfaces which minimise frost formation.\n\n“I would love to see biomimicking of these surfaces for important applications, for example, de-icing of aircrafts,” says Kavehpour. Currently, airlines spend a lot of time and money using chemical de-icers on aeroplanes, as ice can alter the vehicles’ aerodynamic properties and can even cause them to crash.",

    "TITLE": "Do e-cigarettes make it harder to stop smoking?",
    "PARAGRAPH": "(A) People trying to give up smoking often use e-cigarettes to help wean themselves off tobacco. Most experts think they are safer than cigarettes but a surprising paper was published recently - it suggests that people who use e-cigarettes are less successful at giving up smoking than those who don't. \"E-cigarettes WON'T help you quit,\" reported the Daily Mail. \"Smokers using vapers are '28% less likely to ditch traditional cigarettes,'\" read the paper's headline. The story was reported on many other websites around the world, including CBS: \"Study: E-cigarettes don't help smokers quit,\" it said.\n\n  (B) The study causing the fuss was written by researchers at the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, and published in one of the Lancet's sister journals, Lancet Respiratory Medicine. It is a meta-analysis, which means the authors reviewed the academic literature already available on the topic. They sifted out the weaker papers - ones that didn't have control groups, for example - and were left with 20.\n\n  (C) The conclusion? Smokers who use e-cigarettes have a 28% lower chance of quitting than smokers who don't use them, according to Prof Stanton Glantz, one of the authors. But while the conclusion is surprising, so is the number of academics who have criticised the paper. One was Ann McNeill, professor of tobacco addiction at Kings College London, whose own research is included in Glantz's analysis. \"This review is not scientific,\" she wrote on the Science Media Centre website. \"The information… about two studies that I co-authored is either inaccurate or misleading… I believe the findings should therefore be dismissed.\n\n  (D) \"I am concerned at the huge damage this publication may have - many more smokers may continue smoking and die if they take from this piece of work that all evidence suggests e-cigarettes do not help you quit smoking; that is not the case.\" Prof Peter Hajek, director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at the Wolfson Institute also called the findings \"grossly misleading\".\n\n  (E) The critics are making three main points. First, the definition of e-cigarettes is a bit loose. There are many different types - some look like cigarettes, others have tanks for the vaping liquid, some are disposable and other are multi-use. They all deliver different doses of nicotine. Many of the papers included in the analysis don't specify which type people are using, according to Linda Bauld, professor of health policy at the University of Stirling. Another point is that the studies vary in the way they measure how often people use e-cigarettes. \"Some only assessed whether a person had ever tried an e-cigarette or if they had tried one recently, not whether they were using it regularly or frequently,\" Bauld says.\n\n  (F) Even the paper's author admits it's possible that in some of the studies e-cigarettes may only have been used once, which he says would not be a good predictor of whether they had affected people's ability to stop smoking. And there is another problem. You might expect, if you were going to draw conclusions about how useful e-cigarettes are in helping people quit, to focus on studies looking at people who are trying to give up. Prof Robert West, who heads a team at University College London researching ways to help people stop smoking, says this analysis mashed together some very different studies - only some of which include people using e-cigarettes to help them quit.\n\n  (G) \"To mix them in with studies where you've got people using an e-cigarette and are not particularly trying to stop smoking is mixing apples and oranges,\" he says. Some of the studies track smokers who use e-cigarettes for other reasons - perhaps because smoking a cigarette in a bar or an office is illegal and they want a nicotine hit. \"With the studies where people are using electronic cigarettes specifically in a quit attempt the evidence is consistent,\" says West, referring to two randomised control trials.\n\n  (H) Both are quite small and one was funded by the e-cigarette industry. They took two groups of smokers, and gave one real e-cigarettes, and the other a placebo. The studies reach a broadly similar conclusion to a large, real-world study called the Smoking Toolkit run by West. West's investigation follows people in their daily lives and assesses how successful various methods of giving up smoking are - this includes nicotine patches, medicines and going cold turkey. These studies suggest that people using e-cigarettes to help them quit are 50% to 100% more successful than those who use no aids at all.\n\n  (I) In his paper, Glantz acknowledges there are limitations to the research that he analysed. He agrees there are problems with the way the use of e-cigarettes is measured and accepts it's not clear which devices people are using. But he is sticking by his analysis because he believes he has taken these factors into account. The editor of Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Emma Grainger, defends the article too. She says she does not see a problem with the paper and that it has been through the normal peer-review process.",

    "TITLE": "How bacteria invented gene editing",
    "PARAGRAPH": "This week the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority okayed a proposal to modify human embryos through gene editing. The research, which will be carried out at the Francis Crick Institute in London, should improve our understanding of human development. It will also undoubtedly attract controversy - particularly with claims that manipulating embryonic genomes is a first step towards designer babies. Those concerns shouldn't be ignored. After all, gene editing of the kind that will soon be undertaken at the Francis Crick Institute doesn't occur naturally in humans or other animals.\n\nIt is, however, a lot more common in nature than you might think, and it's been going on for a surprisingly long time - revelations that have challenged what biologists thought they knew about the way evolution works. We're talking here about one particular gene editing technique called CRISPR-Cas, or just CRISPR. It's relatively fast, cheap and easy to edit genes with CRISPR - factors that explain why the technique has exploded in popularity in the last few years. But CRISPR wasn't dreamed up from scratch in a laboratory. This gene editing tool actually evolved in single-celled microbes.\n\nCRISPR went unnoticed by biologists for decades. It was only at the tail end of the 1980s that researchers studying Escherichia coli noticed that there were some odd repetitive sequences at the end of one of the bacterial genes. Later, these sequences would be named Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats - CRISPRs. For several years the significance of these CRISPRs was a mystery, even when researchers noticed that they were always separated from one another by equally odd 'spacer' gene sequences.\n\nThen, a little over a decade ago, scientists made an important discovery. Those 'spacer' sequences look odd because they aren't bacterial in origin. Many are actually snippets of DNA from viruses that are known to attack bacteria. In 2005, three research groups independently reached the same conclusion: CRISPR and its associated genetic sequences were acting as a bacterial immune system. In simple terms, this is how it works. A bacterial cell generates special proteins from genes associated with the CRISPR repeats (these are called CRISPR associated - Cas - proteins). If a virus invades the cell, these Cas proteins bind to the viral DNA and help cut out a chunk. Then, that chunk of viral DNA gets carried back to the bacterial cell's genome where it is inserted - becoming a spacer. From now on, the bacterial cell can use the spacer to recognise that particular virus and attack it more effectively.\n\nThese findings were a revelation. Geneticists quickly realised that the CRISPR system effectively involves microbes deliberately editing their own genomes - suggesting the system could form the basis of a brand new type of genetic engineering technology. They worked out the mechanics of the CRISPR system and got it working in their lab experiments. It was a breakthrough that paved the way for this week's announcement by the HFEA. Exactly who took the key steps to turn CRISPR into a useful genetic tool is, however, the subject of a huge controversy. Perhaps that's inevitable - credit for developing CRISPR gene editing will probably guarantee both scientific fame and financial wealth.\n\nBeyond these very important practical applications, though, there's another CRISPR story. It's the account of how the discovery of CRISPR has influenced evolutionary biology. Sometimes overlooked is the fact that it wasn't just geneticists who were excited by CRISPR's discovery - so too were biologists. They realised CRISPR was evidence of a completely unexpected parallel between the way humans and bacteria fight infections. We've known for a long time that part of our immune system \"learns\" about the pathogens it has seen before so it can adapt and fight infections better in future. Vertebrate animals were thought to be the only organisms with such a sophisticated adaptive immune system. In light of the discovery of CRISPR, it seemed some bacteria had their own version. In fact, it turned out that lots of bacteria have their own version. At the last count, the CRISPR adaptive immune system was estimated to be present in about 40% of bacteria. Among the other major group of single-celled microbes - the archaea - CRISPR is even more common. It's seen in about 90% of them. If it's that common today, CRISPR must have a history stretching back over millions - possibly even billions - of years. \"It's clearly been around for a while,\" says Darren Griffin at the University of Kent.\n\nThe animal adaptive immune system, then, isn't nearly as unique as we thought. And there's one feature of CRISPR that makes it arguably even better than our adaptive immune system: CRISPR is heritable. When we are infected by a pathogen, our adaptive immune system learns from the experience, making our next encounter with that pathogen less of an ordeal. This is why vaccination is so effective: it involves priming us with a weakened version of a pathogen to train our adaptive immune system. Your children, though, won't benefit from the wealth of experience locked away in your adaptive immune system. They have to experience an infection - or be vaccinated - first hand before they can learn to deal with a given pathogen.\n\nCRISPR is different. When a microbe with CRISPR is attacked by a virus, the record of the encounter is hardwired into the microbe's DNA as a new spacer. This is then automatically passed on when the cell divides into daughter cells, which means those daughter cells know how to fight the virus even before they've seen it. We don't know for sure why the CRISPR adaptive immune system works in a way that seems, at least superficially, superior to ours. But perhaps our biological complexity is the problem, says Griffin. \"In complex organisms any minor [genetic] changes cause profound effects on the organism,\" he says. Microbes might be sturdy enough to constantly edit their genomes during their lives and cope with the consequences - but animals probably aren't. The discovery of this heritable immune system was, however, a biologically astonishing one. It means that some microbes write their lifetime experiences of their environment into their genome and then pass the information to their offspring – and that is something that evolutionary biologists did not think happened.\n\nDarwin's theory of evolution is based on the idea that natural selection acts on the naturally occurring random variation in a population. Some organisms are better adapted to the environment than others, and more likely to survive and reproduce, but this is largely because they just happened to be born that way. But before Darwin, other scientists had suggested different mechanisms through which evolution might work. One of the most famous ideas was proposed by a French scientist called Jean-Bapteste Lamarck. He thought organisms actually changed during their life, acquiring useful new adaptations non-randomly in response to their environmental experiences. They then passed on these changes to their offspring.\n\nPeople often use giraffes to illustrate Lamarck's hypothesis. The idea is that even deep in prehistory, the giraffe's ancestor had a penchant for leaves at the top of trees. This early giraffe had a relatively short neck, but during its life it spent so much time stretching to reach leaves that its neck lengthened slightly. The crucial point, said Lamarck, was that this slightly longer neck was somehow inherited by the giraffe's offspring. These giraffes also stretched to reach high leaves during their lives, meaning their necks lengthened just a little bit more, and so on. Once Darwin's ideas gained traction, Lamarck's ideas became deeply unpopular. But the CRISPR immune system - in which specific lifetime experiences of the environment are passed on to the next generation - is one of a tiny handful of natural phenomena that arguably obeys Lamarckian principles.\n\n\"The realisation that Lamarckian type of evolution does occur and is common enough, was as startling to biologists as it seems to a layperson,\" says Eugene Koonin at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, who explored the idea with his colleagues in 2009, and does so again in a paper due to be published later this year. This isn't to say that all of Lamarck's thoughts on evolution are back in vogue. \"Lamarck had additional ideas that were important to him, such as the inherent drive to perfection that to him was a key feature of evolution,\" says Koonin. No modern evolutionary biologist goes along with that idea. But the discovery of the CRISPR system still implies that evolution isn't purely the result of Darwinian random natural selection. It can sometimes involve elements of non-random Lamarckism too – a \"continuum\", as Koonin puts it. In other words, the CRISPR story has had a profound scientific impact far beyond the doors of the genetic engineering lab. It truly was a transformative discovery.",

    "TITLE": "Cognitive dissonance",
    "PARAGRAPH": "(A) Charles Darwin said, “This not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.” So you've sold your home, quit your job, shunned your colleagues, abandoned your friends and family. The end of the world is nigh, and you 'know for a fact' that you are one of the chosen few who will be swept up from the 'great flood' approaching on 21st December at midnight to be flown to safety on a far off planet. And then midnight on 21st December comes around and there is no flood. No end of the world. No flying saucer to the rescue. What do you do? Admit you were wrong? Acknowledge that you gave up position, money, friends - for nothing? Tell yourself and others you have been a schmuck? Not on your life.\n\n \n\n(B) Social psychologist Leon Festinger infiltrated a flying saucer doomsday cult in the late 1950s. The members of this cult had given up everything on the premise that the world was about to self destruct and that they, because of their faith, would be the sole survivors. In the lead up to the fateful day, the cult shunned publicity and shied away from journalists. Festinger posed as a cultist and was present when the space ship failed to show up. He was curious about what would happen. How would the disappointed cultists react to the failure of their prophecy? Would they be embarrassed and humiliated? What actually happened amazed him.\n\n \n\n(C) Now, after the non-event, the cultists suddenly wanted publicity. They wanted media attention and coverage. Why? So they could explain how their faith and obedience had helped save the planet from the flood. The aliens had spared planet earth for their sake - and now their new role was to spread the word and make us all listen. This fascinated Festinger. He observed that the real driving force behind the cultists' apparently inexplicable response was the need, not to face the awkward and uncomfortable truth and 'change their minds', but rather to 'make minds comfortable' - to smooth over the unacceptable inconsistencies.\n\n \n\n(D) Festinger coined the term 'cognitive dissonance' to describe the uncomfortable tension we feel when we experience conflicting thoughts or beliefs (cognitions), or engage in behavior that is apparently opposed to our stated beliefs. What is particularly interesting is the lengths to which people will go to reduce the inner tension without accepting that they might, in fact, be wrong. They will accept almost any form of relief, other than admitting being at fault, or mistaken. Festinger quickly realized that our intolerance for 'cognitive dissonance' could explain many mysteries of human behavior.\n\n \n\n(E) In a fascinating experiment Festinger and his colleagues paid some subjects twenty dollars to tell a specific lie, while they paid another group of subjects only one dollar to do the same. Those who were paid just one dollar were far more likely to claim, after the event, that they had actually believed in the lie they were told to tell. Why? Well, because it's just so much harder to justify having done something that conflicts with your own sense of being 'an honest person' for a mere pittance. If you get more money, you can tell yourself: 'Yeah, I lied, but I got well paid! It was justified.' But for one dollar? That's not a good enough reason to lie, so what you were saying must have been true in the first place, right?\n\n \n\n(F) Emotional factors influence how we vote for our politicians much more than our careful and logical appraisal of their policies, according to Drew Westen, a professor of psychiatry and psychology. This may come as little surprise to you, but what about when we learn that our favored politician may be dishonest? Do we take the trouble to really find out what they are supposed to have done, and so possibly have to change our opinions (and our vote), or do we experience that nasty cognitive dissonance and so seek to keep our minds comfortable at the possible cost of truth?\n\n \n\n(G) Cognitive dissonance is essentially a matter of commitment to the choices one has made, and the ongoing need to satisfactorily justify that commitment, even in the face of convincing but conflicting evidence. This is why it can take a long time to leave a cult or an abusive relationship - or even to stop smoking. Life's commitments, whether to a job, a social cause, or a romantic partner, require heavy emotional investment, and so carry significant emotional risks. If people didn’t keep to their commitments, they would experience uncomfortable emotional tension. In a way, it makes sense that our brains should be hard-wired for monitoring and justifying our choices and actions - so as to avoid too much truth breaking in at once and overwhelming us.\n\n \n\n(H) I guess we can't really develop unless we start to get a grip and have some personal honesty about what really motivates us. This is part of genuine maturity. If I know I am being lazy, and can admit it to myself, that at least is a first step to correcting it. If, however, I tell myself it's more sensible to wait before vacuuming, then I can go around with a comfortable self-concept of 'being sensible' while my filthy carpets and laziness remain unchanged. Cognitive dissonance can actually help me mature, if I can bring myself, first, to notice it (making it conscious) and second, to be more open to the message it brings me, in spite of the discomfort. As dissonance increases, providing I do not run away into self-justification, I can get a clearer and clearer sense of what has changed, and what I need to do about it.\nAnd then I can remember what Darwin had to say about who will survive...",

    "TITLE": "Sponging dolphins",
    "PARAGRAPH": "(A) In 1984, researchers spotted dolphins doing something unusual in Shark Bay, Western Australia. When the animals got hungry, they ripped a marine basket sponge from the sea floor and fitted it over their beaks like a person would fit a glove over a hand. The scientists suspected that as the dolphins foraged for fish, the sponges protected their beaks, or rostra, from the rocks and broken chunks of coral that litter the sea floor, making this behavior the first example of tool use in this species.\n\n\n(B) The researchers surmised that a long time ago one ingenious Shark Bay dolphin figured out that by prodding the sediments with a sponge attached to her beak, she could stir up these swim bladder-less fish without being hurt. Eventually, such technique became popular among other dolphins. But why do dolphins go to all of this trouble when they could simply snag a fish from the open sea? The answer is that the bottom-dwelling fish are a lot more nutritious. Some species also don't have swim bladders, gas chambers that help other fish control their buoyancy as they travel up and down the water column. In the Bahamas, where dolphins are also known to forage for bottom-dwelling fish, dolphins hunt partly by echolocating these bladders, which give off a strong acoustic signal. That helps the cetaceans find prey even when it's buried in sea sand. But bottom-dwelling fish, such as barred sandperch, which are favored by some Shark Bay dolphins, don't have swim bladders and so are harder to find with echolocation. The sea floor is not nearly as soft here as it is in the Bahamas, so if dolphins want to probe for these fish, they risk injuring their rostra.\n\n\n(C) Not every dolphin in Shark Bay hunts with sponges. \"It's primarily done by females,\" says Janet Mann, a behavioral ecologist. She believes the female dolphins invented the method because of the \"selective pressures they face while raising a calf as long as they do,\" about 4 to 5 years. \"These clever dolphins have figured out a way to target fish that other dolphins cannot,\" she says, adding that even the local fishermen do not catch, or even know about, this particular species. Mann's previous research has shown that dolphin mothers pass the sponging method to their daughters and some of their sons, rare evidence of a cultural tradition in an animal other than humans. The team has documented three generations of sponging dolphins.\n\n\n(D) The foraging technique came to light a few decades ago - very recently in evolutionary terms - when a local fisherman spotted what looked like a strange tumour on a dolphin’s nose. Researchers eventually worked out that the ‘tumour’ was a conically shaped sponge and it became apparent that the dolphins would spend considerable time searching for one the right shape to fit their nose. The sponge is used to scatter the sand gently on the sea floor and disturb buried fish. When a fish is spotted, the dolphin drops the sponge and gives chase. \"It has been thought that behaviours which are exclusively learnt from one parent are not very stable. With our model we could now show that sponging can be a stable behaviour,\" said Dr Anna Kopps, a biologist at the University of New South Wales.\n\n\n(E) By modelling the emergence of \"sponger\" dolphins in a computer simulation, the team of researchers could see different scenarios in which the skill could have spread among the dolphin population over the years. They then compared the results of these simulations with field data on the genetic relationship between the spongers, to estimate the role of mothers teaching their offspring in transmitting the skill. They found that if the likelihood of a sponger's offspring learning the ability was less than certain, the dolphins that did pick up the technique needed to gain a survival advantage from the skill, in order for the ability to pass on to the next generation. The model also allowed them to attempt to calculate the date that the behaviour was likely to have originated.\"The results suggested that sponging was innovated at least 120 to 180 years ago - it is only a best estimate,\" said Dr Kopps. Scientists discovered that although dolphins tried to teach the hunting technique to all their young, it was mainly female offspring that grasped the concept. Why male offspring rarely acquire the same skill remains unclear, though the team put forward one possible explanation: male bottlenose dolphins tend to form close bonds with other males, and such alliances aren't suited to seabed foraging, since it is a time-consuming, solitary activity.\n\n\n(F) The US scientists say discovering a new tool is a direct sign of intelligence. “There’s a strong link between animals with larger brains and tool users. Bottlenose dolphins have a brain second in size only to humans.” said Janet Mann, a marine biologist who led the research. “Dolphins are already good at catching fish so they don’t need tools, but they’ve discovered this sponge makes their job easier. Working out how to use tools in a creative way like that is a hallmark of intelligence.” Mann admits we still do not understand dolphins well. “It’s hard to get inside their heads because their brains are constructed differently and it’s very hard to analyse their language, but they do seem very intelligent,” she said.\n\n\n(G) Dolphins are also often seen engaging in playful behaviour and creating tools to use for entertainment. They have been observed to blow bubbles which they form into rings to play with. After creating the bubble ring, a dolphin will use its nose and body to maintain the shape of the bubble and keep it from floating to the surface. The study provides a \"better understanding of the why and how of sponging\" by the Shark Bay dolphins, says Louis Herman, a cognitive psychologist. The work \"adds to previously documented\" examples of \"innovation by this highly intelligent species.\" Patterson's and Mann's results also \"reinforce a pattern\" often seen in other tool-using animals, says Simon Reader, a behavioral biologist. \"Tool use appears to be almost a last option, taken when other options fail or are unavailable,\" he says, noting that woodpecker finches in the Galápagos Islands \"turn to tool use only in arid areas,\" wielding cactus spines to extract grubs from tree branches. Using tools takes time and energy, Reader says, and animals tend to rely on them only when there's a guaranteed payoff, such as turning up a fatty fish that most other dolphins (and fishermen) know nothing about.",

    "TITLE": "All The Ways Women Are Still Pressured To Put Family Before Career",
    "PARAGRAPH": "(A) There’s no denying that women around the world have made great strides toward equality in the past century. One hundred years ago, women in the United States still didn’t have the right to vote, and very few were allowed to pursue higher education or a meaningful career outside of their household duties. Fast forward to today, and more than 70 percent of women between the ages of 20 and 54 are active members of the national workforce. On top of this, 2015 marked the first year when women were, on average, more likely to have a bachelor’s degree than men, and this trend is on the rise.\n\n\n  (B) But despite all this newfound opportunity, the prevailing societal attitudes about what women are historically supposed to value still have a long way to go. That’s why we’ve partnered with SK-II to learn more about all of the ways women are still pressured to stick to outdated gender norms. “Women have won unprecedented rights thanks to the feminist movement, but as a society, we still expect women to prioritize family over career, or even over their own needs,” says Silvia Dutchevici, president and founder of the Critical Therapy Center in New York City. Dutchevici says many women feel pressure to “have it all,” meaning both a thriving career and the perfect family, but that can be very difficult to achieve.\n\n\n  (C) “Most women try to balance work and family,” Dutchevici says, “but that balance is seldom equal.” In fact, she says working mothers ― even those with partners ― often find themselves essentially working two full-time jobs: keeping their career together while doing the brunt of housework, cooking and child-rearing. This happens for a variety of reasons, but societal expectations about the roles of women and men at home are still very much to blame, says Tamra Lashchyk, a Wall Street executive, business coach and author of the book “Lose the Gum: A Survival Guide to Women on Wall Street.”\n\n\n  (D) “No matter how successful she is, the burden of running a household still falls on the woman’s shoulders,” Lashchyk says. “Men get more of a pass when it comes to these duties, especially those that involve children.” Lashchyk says much of this pressure on women to conform to a more domestic lifestyle comes from friends and family.\n\n\n  (E) “In many people’s minds, a woman’s career success pales in comparison to having a family,” she says. “Especially if the woman is single, no matter how great her professional achievements, almost every single one of her conversations with her family will include questions about her romantic life or lack thereof. I could literally tell my family I’d cured cancer and the conversation would still end with, ‘But are you dating anyone?’” While covert societal expectations might contribute to some of this inequality, workplace policies on maternity and paternity leave can hold a lot of the blame.\n\n\n  (F) “Unfortunately, many workplace policies regarding taking time off to care for family do not the changing times,” Dutchevici says. “Both men and women suffer in their careers when they prioritize family, but women carry far harsher punishments. Their choice to take time off and start a family can result in lower pay, and fewer promotions in the future. The right to family leave is not a woman’s issue, it is a society’s issue, a family’s issue.” Lashchyk agrees with this sentiment. “There should be more flexibility and benefits [in the workplace], like longer periods of time for paternity leave….If paternity leave was extended, men could share a greater responsibility in child care, and they could also spend more time bonding with their infant children, which is beneficial for the entire family.\n\n\n  (G) Another less visible way the modern workplace forces women to choose family over career has to do with the fact that women are pushing back pregnancy, says Jeni Mayorskaya, a fertility expert and CEO of Stork Club, an online community for women dedicated to fertility issues. “Compared to our parents, our generation is having children a decade later,” Mayorskaya says. “Unfortunately, when we hit our mid-30s and we’re finally ready for that managing position or that title of a partner at a firm we fought so hard for, we have to think about putting our career on pause and becoming a mom.”\n\n\n  (H) So what can women do to combat these societal pressures? Finding workplaces that offer flexible schedules, work-at-home opportunities and ample maternity and paternity leave is a good first step, but Dr. Neeta Bhushan, an emotional intelligence advocate and author, says women should also learn to put themselves first. “The first step is being mindful of your emotional health in your relationships with others and the relationship you have with yourself,“ Bhushan says. “When you put yourself first, you are able to make a bigger impact on your community. This is different than being selfish ― think beyond you. You want to make sure that you are being taken care of so that you can take care of others.”",

    "TITLE": "The Cambrian Explosion and Mass Extinction",
    "PARAGRAPH": "The Cambrian period, occurring between approximately 542–488 million years ago, marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla (a class of species) and animal diversity in Earth’s history. It is believed that most of the animal phyla in existence today had their origins during this time, often referred to as the Cambrian explosion. Echinoderms, mollusks, worms, arthropods, and chordates arose during this period.\nThe cause of the Cambrian explosion is still debated. There are many theories that attempt to answer this question. Environmental changes may have created a more suitable environment for animal life. Examples of these changes include rising atmospheric oxygen levels and large increases in oceanic calcium concentrations that preceded the Cambrian period. Some scientists believe that an expansive, continental shelf with numerous shallow lagoons or pools provided the necessary living space for larger numbers of different types of animals to co-exist. There is also support for theories that argue that relationships between species, such as changes in the food web, competition for food and space, and predator-prey relationships, were ready to promote a sudden massive coevolution of species. Theories that attempt to explain why the Cambrian explosion happened must be able to provide valid reasons for the massive animal diversification, as well as explain why it happened when it did. There is evidence that both supports and refutes each of the theories described above, and the answer may very well be a combination of these and other theories.\nHowever, unresolved questions about the animal diversification that took place during the Cambrian period remain. For example, we do not understand how the evolution of so many species occurred in such a short period of time. Was there really an “explosion” of life at this particular time? Some scientists question the validity of this idea because there is increasing evidence to suggest that more animal life existed prior to the Cambrian period and that other similar species’ so-called explosions occurred later in history as well. Furthermore, the vast diversification of animal species that appears to have begun during the Cambrian period continued well into the following Ordovician period. Despite some of these arguments, most scientists agree that the Cambrian period marked a time of impressively rapid animal evolution and diversification that is unmatched elsewhere during history.\nThe periods that followed the Cambrian during the Paleozoic Era are marked by further animal evolution and the emergence of many new orders, families, and species. As animal phyla continued to diversify, new species adapted to new ecological conditions. During the Ordovician period, which followed the Cambrian period, plant life first appeared on land. This change allowed formerly aquatic animal species to invade land, feeding directly on plants or decaying vegetation.\nChanges in the environment often create new niches (living spaces) that contribute to rapid speciation and increased diversity. On the other hand, cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life, can result in devastating losses of diversity. Such periods of mass extinction have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life, erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind. The end of the Permian period (and the Paleozoic Era) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth’s history, a loss of roughly 95 percent of the species at that time. Some of the dominant phyla in the world’s oceans, such as the trilobites, disappeared completely. On land, the disappearance of some dominant species of Permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles to emerge: the dinosaurs. The warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing Mesozoic Era promoted an explosive diversification of dinosaurs into every conceivable niche in land, air, and water. Plants, too, moved into new landscapes and empty niches, creating complex communities of producers and consumers, some of which became very large on the abundant food available.\nSource: OpenStax.

    "TITLE": "Supply Chains: An In-Depth Analysis",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Supply chains represent complex networks that help produce and distribute goods, from the initial sourcing of raw materials to the final delivery to consumers. These systems are essential to the functioning of modern economies, facilitating the smooth flow of products and services across various sectors. The development of supply chains has been significantly influenced by technological improvements, globalization, and changing consumer choices. At its core, a supply chain consists of multiple parties, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers, each playing an important role in ensuring that products reach their intended destinations efficiently and effectively.\n\nA foundational part of any supply chain is sourcing, which involves the planned sourcing of raw materials and components needed for production. This process requires careful thought about factors such as cost, quality, and reliability of suppliers. For instance, companies often form long-term partnerships with suppliers to secure good terms and ensure a steady supply of materials. The rise of e-commerce has further changed sourcing practices, as businesses increasingly rely on digital platforms to find and engage suppliers. As a result, the sourcing process has become more flexible, allowing companies to respond quickly to market changes and evolving consumer demands.\n\nFollowing sourcing, the production phase is where raw materials are turned into finished goods. This stage includes various activities, such as manufacturing, assembly, and quality control. The efficiency of production processes is crucial; delays or inefficiencies can lead to higher costs and customer dissatisfaction. Lean manufacturing principles, which focus on minimizing waste and maximizing productivity, have gained importance in recent years. By adopting these principles, companies can streamline their operations and improve their competitiveness in the marketplace. Furthermore, the inclusion of automation and robotics in production has changed the industry, enabling faster and more precise manufacturing processes. However, this shift also raises questions about the future of the workforce and the potential for job loss.\n\nDistribution is another important part of supply chains, involving the logistics of transporting goods from production facilities to end-users. This phase requires careful planning and coordination to ensure timely delivery while minimizing costs. Various transportation methods, including road, rail, air, and sea, are used based on factors such as distance, need, and product type. The rise of technology has significantly improved distribution efficiency, with improvements such as real-time tracking systems and advanced inventory management software. These tools allow companies to monitor their shipments closely, optimize routes, and manage stock levels effectively, enhancing overall supply chain performance. However, the reliance on technology also introduces weaknesses, as cyber threats can disrupt operations and threaten sensitive data.\n\nDespite the progress in supply chain management, many challenges remain. Global events, such as natural disasters, political instability, and emergencies, can disrupt supply chains, leading to delays and increased costs. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, exposed significant weaknesses in global supply chains, prompting companies to reassess their strategies. Many organizations have begun to diversify their supplier base and invest in local sourcing to reduce the risks associated with relying too much on a single supplier or region. Additionally, sustainability has become a pressing concern, with consumers increasingly demanding environmentally friendly practices. As a result, companies are now exploring ways to lower their carbon footprint and improve the sustainability of their supply chains. However, the balance between cost-effectiveness and sustainability remains a contentious issue, with differing opinions on the best ways to achieve these goals.\n\nIn conclusion, supply chains are vital to the functioning of modern economies, helping the movement of goods and services across various sectors. The evolution of supply chain management has been influenced by technological advancements, globalization, and changing consumer choices. While challenges remain, such as disruptions from global events and the need for sustainable practices, companies are continually adapting their plans to enhance efficiency and resilience. As the landscape of supply chains continues to change, it is imperative for businesses to remain quick and responsive to emerging trends and challenges. Future inquiries may focus on the effects of automation on employment, the effectiveness of local versus global sourcing, and the role of technology in improving supply chain transparency and security.",

    "TITLE": "Peepshow Cinema",
    "PARAGRAPH": "The widespread consumption of cinema wasn't achieved until technological advancements transformed it from a solitary \"peepshow\" experience into a system capable of projecting images onto a large screen within a darkened theater. In its initial form, the film was viewed through a small opening in a specialized device – the Kinetoscope, introduced by Thomas Edison in 1894. Designed for Kinetoscope parlors, these arcades contained a limited number of individual machines, each allowing only one viewer at a time to witness a brief, 50-foot film. These early parlors mirrored the success of phonograph parlors, where patrons listened to recordings through personal ear tubes, moving from machine to machine to experience various speeches or musical pieces. Similarly, patrons in Kinetoscope parlors moved between machines, viewing a selection of short films (or, for popular events like prizefights, consecutive rounds of a single bout) for a price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine).\n\nThe design of these Kinetoscope arcades was inspired by phonograph parlors, which had demonstrated success for Edison in previous years. In phonograph parlors, patrons utilized individual ear tubes to listen to various recorded speeches or musical pieces while transitioning between different machines. Edison's primary focus was on selling Kinetoscopes (priced around $1,000 each) to these parlors, rather than the films themselves (which cost approximately $10-$15 a piece). In fact, he actively opposed the development of projection technology, fearing that by offering projectors, exhibitors would only purchase one machine from him instead of multiple Kinetoscopes.\n\nExhibitors, however, aimed to maximize their profits, a task they could accomplish more readily by projecting several films simultaneously to hundreds of customers (as opposed to individually) and charging 25 to 50 cents for admission. This demand ultimately led to the development of projection devices by showmen like the Lumière brothers, Thomas Armat, and others around 1895-1896. These early projectors opened the door for showcasing films in a variety of venues – vaudeville theaters, legitimate theaters, town halls, makeshift storefront theaters, fairgrounds, and even amusement parks, all catering to a mass audience.\n\nThe arrival of projection in 1895-1896 marked a pivotal moment, transforming motion pictures into the ultimate form of mass entertainment. Prior theatrical experiences, such as vaudeville, popular dramas, musicals, minstrel shows, classical plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern shows, typically catered to audiences of several hundred at a time. However, films differed significantly. Traditional entertainment relied heavily on live performance or, in the case of slide-and-lantern shows, the involvement of a master of ceremonies who curated the program.\n\nWhile early exhibitors often incorporated live acts alongside films, the core content – the movies themselves – was pre-recorded and readily reproducible. Exhibitors did shape their film programs by mixing and matching films with other forms of entertainment, or by accompanying them with lectures, but their creative control remained limited. The true draw for audiences was the technological marvel itself – the lifelike portrayal of everyday events, from trains and crashing waves to people walking down the street, coupled with the magic of trick photography and camera manipulation.\n\nProjection fundamentally altered the way viewers experienced the film, no longer a solitary act like the Kinetoscope. It became a public experience shared with dozens, even hundreds of others. The image size also underwent a dramatic transformation, expanding from the minuscule dimensions of a peepshow (1-2 inches) to the life-sized proportions of a large screen (6-9 feet). This evolution from a private viewing experience to a shared, larger-than-life spectacle marked the true birth of cinema as a dominant force in mass entertainment.",

    "TITLE": "Craftsmen vs Industrialization",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Before 1815, manufacturing in the United States was primarily conducted within homes or workshops by proficient artisans. These master craftworkers transmitted their trade expertise to apprentices and journeymen. Additionally, women frequently engaged in part-time work from home, crafting finished goods using raw materials provided by merchant capitalists. However, following 1815, this traditional mode of manufacturing gradually yielded to factory-based production, where machinery was operated by unskilled or semi-skilled workers. Factors such as affordable transportation systems, urbanization, and increased access to capital and credit played pivotal roles in driving this transition towards factory production.\n\nThe establishment of a workforce accustomed to factory labor didn't take place smoothly. Prior to the emergence of factories, artisans typically worked from home. Apprentices were considered part of the family, with masters tasked not only with teaching them a trade but also providing education and overseeing their moral conduct. Journeymen understood that by honing their craft, they could ascend to respected master artisans with their own workshops. Moreover, skilled artisans didn't adhere to fixed schedules or work at a consistent pace; instead, they engaged in intermittent periods of intense labor interspersed with leisurely intervals. \n\nThe introduction of factories brought about a significant shift. Items manufactured in factories lacked the refined quality and intricate craftsmanship of handmade goods. The emphasis on pride in one's craftsmanship yielded to the necessity of increasing productivity rates. With the advent of new business methods came a heightened adherence to punctuality. Factory life imposed a structured schedule, with work commencing at the signal of a bell, and workers being expected to maintain a steady pace of operation. Additionally, industrialization necessitated a departure from old habits, demanding workers who were vigilant, reliable, and self-disciplined. Instances of absenteeism or tardiness hindered productivity and disrupted the established factory routine, given the specialized nature of tasks. Industrialization not only revolutionized the organization of work but also fundamentally altered its essence.\n\nThe initial generation to encounter these transformations found it challenging to embrace these mindsets. The factory clock emerged as a symbol of the altered work regulations. An example is provided by a mill worker who eventually resigned, articulating discontent about \"obedience to the ding-dong of the bell—just as though we are so many living machines.\" With the erosion of personal liberties, there also came a decline in social standing. Unlike artisan workshops where apprentices closely collaborated with overseeing masters, factories created a distinct separation between laborers and management. Few workers ascended to supervisory roles, and even fewer realized the artisan's aspiration of establishing their own enterprise. Despite receiving adequate wages, workers sensed a deterioration in their societal status.\n\nIn this emerging economic landscape, workers occasionally came together to safeguard their rights and traditional lifestyles. Artisans such as carpenters, printers, and tailors formed unions, culminating in the formation of the National Trades’ Union in 1834. While the labor movement gained traction in the years leading up to the Panic of 1837, the subsequent depression saw a sharp decline in labor's influence. During these challenging times, few workers were willing to strike or participate in collective actions. Moreover, skilled craft workers, who spearheaded the unionization drive, felt little affinity with semi-skilled factory workers and unskilled laborers. Despite over a decade of agitation, the achievement of a 10-hour workday for most industries and the legal recognition of workers' right to strike in the 1850s had minimal immediate impact.\n\nWorkers shared a common resentment towards industrialization and the decline in their status, yet they were fragmented by various factors such as ethnic and racial divisions, gender disparities, conflicting religious beliefs, differing occupations, political affiliations, and disagreements regarding strategies. They viewed the factory and industrialism not as avenues for advancement, but rather as symbols of their diminished independence and control over their lives. With the increasing specialization and differentiation of United States society, wealth disparities became more pronounced. While the emergence of new markets brought fortunes to a select few, the factory system reduced wages for workers by breaking down labor into smaller, less specialized tasks.",

    "TITLE": "Swimming Devices",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Tunas, mackerels, and billfishes (marlins, sailfishes, and swordfish) maintain continuous movement. They engage in feeding, courtship, reproduction, and even \"rest\" while constantly swimming. Consequently, every aspect of the body structure and function of these “Swimming Devices” is specialized to enhance their swimming capability. \n\nA notable aspect is that numerous adaptations of these fish aim to minimize water resistance, also known as drag. What is intriguing is that several of these hydrodynamic adjustments bear similarities to enhancements meant for enhancing the aerodynamics of fast-moving airplanes. While human engineers are relatively new to this field, tunas and their kin developed these \"high-tech\" designs many years ago. \n\nTunas, mackerels, and billfishes have perfected the art of streamlining with their sleek and compact bodies. The body shapes of tunas, in particular, are nearly optimal from an engineering perspective. Most species lack scales across most of their bodies, resulting in a smooth and slippery surface. Their eyes are flush with the body, covered by a slick, transparent lid that reduces drag. Additionally, their fins are stiff, smooth, and narrow, further reducing drag. When not in use, the fins are tucked into specialized grooves or depressions to maintain the body's smooth contours, similar to how airplanes retract their landing gear during flight for the same purpose.\n\nTunas, mackerels, and billfishes possess even more advanced adaptations than those mentioned earlier to enhance their hydrodynamics. The extended bills found in marlins, sailfishes, and swordfishes likely aid them in navigating smoothly through the water, similar to the needle-like structures seen on many supersonic aircraft at the nose.\n\nTunas and billfishes typically possess a set of keels and finlets close to their tails, while retaining coarse scales near the head known as the corselet. These features, along with the corselet, serve to streamline water flow over their bodies, minimizing resistance. This phenomenon is analogous to the design of supersonic jets.\n\nTunas, due to their continuous swimming, only need to open their mouths for water to be pushed in and circulated over their gills. Consequently, they have minimized the use of muscles utilized by other fish to draw in water and propel it through the gills. Tunas, in essence, rely on swimming to breathe. They must also keep swimming to maintain buoyancy, as many of them have significantly reduced or entirely lost the swim bladder, which aids most other fish in staying afloat.\n\nSome fish lack the swim bladder, which is a gas-filled sac that aids in buoyancy for many other fish. An issue that arises is that when these fish open their mouths to breathe, it affects their streamlined shape and can decrease their speed. Certain tuna species possess unique grooves on their tongues, believed to assist in directing water flow through the mouth and out the gills, thus minimizing water resistance.\n\nThere are modifications that enhance forward thrust and others that decrease resistance. Once again, these fish are highly regarded by engineers. Their elongated tails with swept-back tips are exceptionally well-suited for generating propulsion with minimal exertion. A crucial factor for these fast swimmers, and others like them, is their capacity to detect and utilize swirls and eddies in the water. They can navigate around eddies that might impede their progress and then gain additional thrust by leveraging these eddies. Scientists and engineers are now exploring this fish ability in the quest to develop more effective propulsion systems for ships.\n\nThe muscles of these fish and the system that regulates a warm body temperature are extremely effective. For instance, a bluefin tuna swimming in water at 7°C (45°F) can sustain a core temperature exceeding 25°C (77°F). This elevated body temperature not only benefits muscle function but also enhances the performance of the brain and eyes. In comparison, billfishes have developed specialized \"heaters\" made of modified muscle tissue, which warm the eyes and brain, ensuring optimal functioning of these vital organs.",

    "TITLE": "Earth and Its Landscape ",
    "PARAGRAPH": "While many perceive the landscape on Earth as static, Earth is a dynamic entity, undergoing constant changes to its surface. These alterations occur slowly from a human perspective but comparatively swiftly within the vast timespan of Earth's existence, approximately 4.5 billion years. Two primary factors contribute to shaping the terrain: constructive processes like uplift, which generate new landscape features, and destructive forces such as erosion, which gradually erode exposed landforms.\n\nHills and mountains are commonly perceived as enduring features, resilient against the forces of nature. However, they are relatively short-lived in geological terms. Typically, the higher a mountain, the more recently it formed; for instance, the towering peaks of the Himalayas are approximately 50 million years old. Conversely, lower mountains are often older and represent remnants of once-higher mountain ranges. Around 400 million years ago, during the amalgamation of North America and Europe, the Caledonian mountain range rivaled the Himalayas in size. Today, remnants of this ancient mountain-building event remain in the modest mountains of Greenland, the northern Appalachians, the Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian coastal plateau.\n\nThe Earth's crust is believed to be segmented into large, mobile plates, which glide atop a malleable layer of rock. Certain mountains owe their formation to the collision of these plates, where rock is thrust upwards along plate boundaries. During this process, sedimentary rocks originally laid down on the ocean floor can be uplifted to heights exceeding 26,000 feet. Alternatively, mountains may arise from seismic activity, where earthquakes fracture the crust, displacing enough rock to create block mountains. Another mountain type emerges from volcanic eruptions, particularly in regions with active fold mountain belts like the Cascade Range in western North America. Comprised of lavas and volcanic materials, many peaks in the Cascades are the remnants of extinct volcanoes.\n\nRegardless of the cause behind mountain formation, once land emerges above sea level, it becomes vulnerable to destructive elements. Exposed rocks undergo erosion through diverse weathering processes, breaking down into fragments that are eventually transported and deposited as sediments. Consequently, every landscape embodies a fleeting moment in the ongoing conflict between uplift forces and erosion.\n\nVarious weather phenomena play a significant role in erosion processes. Rainfall, for instance, dislodges loose soil and infiltrates rock crevices. Interaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and rainwater generates carbonic acid, which can chemically corrode rocks. Subsequently, rainwater seeps underground and resurfaces as springs, initiating the formation of streams and rivers. These water bodies carve through rocks, transporting mountain debris to lower elevations.\n\nUnder extremely cold conditions, rocks can undergo fracturing due to ice and frost. Regions with prolonged cold climates may witness the formation of glaciers, and slow-moving ice masses that carve valleys and transport substantial amounts of eroded rock material. Conversely, in arid environments, wind becomes the predominant erosive force, carrying fine sand particles that pummel exposed rock surfaces, gradually breaking them down into finer particles. Additionally, living organisms also play a role in shaping landscapes: tree roots penetrate rock crevices, accelerating their disintegration, while the roots of grasses and other vegetation help bind loose soil, mitigating wind erosion.",

    "TITLE": "Trade Agreements: An In-Depth Analysis",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Trade agreements have become important means in international economic relations, helping the exchange of goods and services across national borders. These agreements can take different forms, including two-sided agreements between two countries, many-sided agreements involving several nations, and regional agreements that focus on specific geographic areas. The main goal of trade agreements is to remove obstacles to trade, like tariffs, quotas, and import restrictions, promoting economic growth and improving the well-being of participating countries. In the past, trade agreements have changed a lot, reflecting shifts in global economic interactions, political relationships, and new ideas. For example, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), established in 1947, laid the groundwork for later trade negotiations and agreements, leading to the formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995.\n\nOne of the most important examples of a trade agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was put into effect in 1994 between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. NAFTA aimed to remove trade obstacles and promote economic teamwork among the three nations. The agreement resulted in a major increase in trade volume, with exports and imports among the member countries rising dramatically. According to data from the Office of the United States Trade Representative, trade between the U.S. and Mexico increased from $81 billion in 1993 to $614 billion in 2016. However, NAFTA also faced disapproval for its effect on domestic industries and employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. Critics argued that the agreement led to job losses in the United States. Companies moved production to Mexico, where labor costs were lower. This debate highlights the complex relationship between trade agreements and domestic economic conditions, raising questions about the balance between free trade and protectionism.\n\nAlternatively, the European Union (EU) represents a more combined approach to trade agreements, covering not only trade in goods and services but also the free movement of people and capital. Established after World War II, the EU has evolved into a smooth market that allows for the easy exchange of goods and services among its member states. The EU's trade agreements often include terms related to environmental standards, labor rights, and consumer protection, reflecting a broader understanding of trade that goes beyond just economic factors. For example, the EU's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada includes commitments to sustainable development and rule-related cooperation. This comprehensive approach has been praised for its inclusivity and reviewed for its complexity. Member states must navigate a variety of regulations and standards, which can sometimes create problems in trade rather than help it.\n\nThe rise of globalization has also led to the growth of regional trade agreements (RTAs), which are designed to help trade among countries within a specific region. For example, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area aims to promote economic integration among its ten member states by reducing tariffs and fostering teamwork. As of 2020, ASEAN countries made up about 8% of global trade, showing the importance of regional agreements in the global economy. RTAs can serve as a stepping stone towards broader multilateral agreements, as they allow countries to build trust and set common standards. However, critics argue that RTAs can create a \"confusion\" effect, where overlapping agreements lead to problems in trade. This situation raises questions about the effectiveness of regional agreements in achieving their goals, especially in a world increasingly defined by complex supply chains.\n\nThe impact of trade agreements on economic growth and development is a subject of continuing research and debate. Supporters argue that trade agreements stimulate economic growth by providing access to larger markets, encouraging foreign direct investment, and fostering competition. For example, studies by the Peterson Institute for International Economics show that countries involved in trade agreements tend to experience higher rates of economic growth compared to those that do not. On the other hand, opponents contend that trade agreements can worsen income inequality and lead to negative social outcomes, especially for at-risk populations. The challenge lies in designing trade agreements that not only promote economic growth but also address social and environmental concerns. For example, including labor rights and environmental protections in trade agreements could help reduce some of the negative effects linked to free trade.\n\nIn conclusion, trade agreements play a vital role in shaping the global economy, influencing trade patterns, and affecting the lives of millions. As nations continue to manage the complexities of international trade, the importance of crafting agreements that balance economic interests with social and environmental considerations cannot be overstated. The future of trade agreements will likely involve a greater focus on sustainability and inclusivity, as countries seek to address the challenges brought by globalization and its impact on local economies. In addition, ongoing dialogue and cooperation among nations will be essential in ensuring that trade agreements serve as a force for positive change in the world. As the landscape of international trade continues to evolve, questions remain about the effectiveness of existing agreements and the potential for new structures that better serve the interests of all parties involved.",

    "TITLE": "Coral Reefs",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Coral reefs, often called the \"rainforests of the sea,\" are among the most varied surroundings on the planet, supporting about 25% of all marine species. These detailed structures are mainly made of chalk, which is secreted by tiny marine organisms known as corals. Found mostly in tropical and subtropical waters, coral reefs thrive in shallow, warm areas, typically at depths of less than 60 meters. The mutually beneficial relationship between corals and zooxanthellae, a type of sunlight-using algae, is crucial for the health of these surroundings. The algae live within the coral tissues, providing essential food through photosynthesis while receiving protection and access to sunlight in return. This mutual relationship is fundamental to the survival of coral reefs, allowing them to flourish in nutrient-poor waters.\n\nThe formation of coral reefs happens over thousands of years, starting with the settlement of coral larvae on suitable surfaces. As these larvae develop into small sea creatures, they secrete chalk, gradually building up the reef structure. There are three main types of coral reefs: fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and ring reefs. Fringing reefs are directly attached to the shore, while barrier reefs are separated from land by a lagoon. Ring reefs, on the other hand, are shaped like a ring and encircle a lagoon but do not have a central landmass. Each type of reef plays an important role in coastal protection, variety of life, and the overall health of marine surroundings. For example, barrier reefs can help reduce wave energy, thereby lowering coastal erosion and protecting shorelines from storm waves.\n\nThe environmental importance of coral reefs cannot be overstated. They serve as critical habitats for a wide variety of marine species, including fish, sea creatures, and marine mammals. This variety of life is essential not only for the health of the ocean but also for the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on fishing and tourism. Furthermore, coral reefs act as natural barriers, protecting coastlines from erosion and storm waves. The complex structures of the reefs absorb wave energy, so they reduce the impact of storms on coastal communities. Research shows that the economic value of coral reefs, through fisheries and tourism, is estimated to be in the billions of dollars each year, highlighting their importance to both environmental balance and human economies.\n\nHowever, coral reefs are facing unmatched threats due to human activities and climate change. Overfishing, pollution, and coastal development have led to serious deterioration of these surroundings. Additionally, rising sea temperatures, a result of global warming, have caused coral bleaching, where corals expel their symbiotic algae, leading to a loss of color and essential food. If the stressors continue, bleached corals may die, resulting in the collapse of the entire reef environment. Scientific studies suggest that coral reefs could decline by up to 70% by the year 2050 if current trends continue, posing a serious risk to the marine variety of life and coastal communities. This alarming prediction raises questions about the effectiveness of current conservation strategies and the need for stronger actions.\n\nIn reaction to these challenges, various conservation efforts have been started globally. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established to safeguard critical habitats and promote sustainable fishing practices. Restoration projects, which involve transplanting healthy corals onto degraded reefs, are also being implemented to enhance strength. Also, research into coral species that show greater tolerance to temperature changes is underway, aiming to develop more resilient coral strains. Public awareness campaigns are essential in educating communities about the importance of coral reefs and the actions they can take to protect these vital surroundings. Despite these efforts, the success of conservation projects often depends on local community involvement and the political will to enforce protective measures.\n\nThe future of coral reefs depends on a collective effort to reduce the impacts of climate change and human activities. While the challenges are tough, the potential for recovery exists if the right measures are taken. The importance of coral reefs goes beyond their ecological value; they are integral to the cultural and economic fabric of many coastal communities. As such, preserving these surroundings is not just an environmental concern but also a matter of social and economic importance. Continued research, conservation, and community involvement will be essential in ensuring that coral reefs can thrive for generations to come.

    "TITLE": "Endangered Species",
    "PARAGRAPH": "The issue of endangered species has gained significant focus in recent decades, mainly due to the concerning speed at which various species are disappearing from our planet. An endangered species is defined as one that is at risk of extinction due to many factors, including habitat loss, climate change, poaching, and pollution. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), over 28,000 species are currently classified as endangered, highlighting the urgent need for thorough conservation actions. The loss of a variety of life not only threatens the survival of individual species but also disrupts ecosystems, which can have far-reaching effects on human health and well-being. This connection raises critical questions about humanity's ethical responsibilities in preserving the natural world.\n\nOne of the main causes of species endangerment is habitat destruction, often resulting from human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. For example, the Amazon rainforest, which is home to about 10% of all known species, is being destroyed at an alarming rate. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) reports that approximately 17% of the Amazon has been lost in the last fifty years, leading to the endangerment of many species, including the jaguar and the Amazon river dolphin. As habitats are broken apart or destroyed, the remaining populations of these species become isolated, making it harder for them to reproduce and thrive. Critics argue that while habitat preservation is crucial, it must be paired with eco-friendly development methods to ensure long-term sustainability.\n\nClimate change also plays an important role in the threat to species. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can alter habitats and food availability, forcing species to adapt or face extinction. For example, polar bears, which rely on sea ice for hunting seals, are experiencing notable population drops as the Arctic ice melts due to global warming. The National Snow and Ice Data Center has reported that the Arctic sea ice extent has decreased by about 40% since the late 1970s. This loss of habitat not only threatens the polar bear population but also disrupts the entire Arctic ecosystem, affecting other species that depend on the same surroundings. Some scientists suggest that adjustment methods, such as moving to cooler areas, may offer a solution, but these methods are often hindered by human intrusion and habitat fragmentation.\n\nIn addition to habitat loss and climate change, poaching remains a major threat to many endangered species. The unlawful animal trade, driven by demand for animal parts such as ivory, fur, and traditional medicine, has led to the severe decline of species like elephants and rhinoceroses. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the unlawful trade in wildlife is worth an estimated $23 billion each year, making it one of the most profitable illegal activities in the world. Efforts to combat poaching have included stricter enforcement of laws, increased penalties for offenders, and international cooperation to break down trafficking networks. However, these measures often face challenges due to dishonesty and not enough resources in affected regions. Some conservationists argue that local initiatives, that involve local populations in conservation efforts, may yield more sustainable results.\n\nConservation efforts aimed at protecting endangered species have taken various forms, including the establishment of protected areas, breeding programs, and public awareness campaigns. Protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves, serve as safe havens for endangered species, allowing them to thrive in their natural surroundings. For example, the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in the United States has helped the recovery of the grey wolf population, which was once on the brink of extinction. Additionally, captive breeding programs have been successful in increasing the populations of species like the California condor and the Arabian oryx, which were once critically endangered. Public awareness campaigns play an important role in educating communities about the importance of variety of life and the need for conservation, fostering a sense of responsibility towards protecting endangered species. However, the effectiveness of these campaigns often depends on cultural attitudes and economic conditions in different regions.\n\nThe importance of preserving endangered species goes beyond the immediate environmental advantages. A variety of life contributes to ecosystem services that are essential for human survival, including clean air and water, pollination of crops, and climate regulation. Furthermore, many cultures around the world hold inherent values associated with wildlife, viewing them as symbols of heritage and identity. Therefore, the loss of species can lead to cultural and spiritual consequences. While the challenges of conserving endangered species are tough, the combined efforts of governments, non-governmental organizations, and local communities can lead to positive outcomes. The ongoing discussion surrounding endangered species serves as a reminder of our connection with the natural world and the responsibility we have to ensure its preservation for future generations. Nevertheless, questions remain about the most effective strategies for conservation, particularly in the face of rapid environmental change and economic and social challenges.",

    "TITLE": "Dadaism: An Artistic Revolution",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Dadaism appeared in the early 20th century as an extreme art movement that aimed to challenge the standards of traditional art and societal expectations. Originating in Zurich, Switzerland, around 1916, Dada was a response to the horrors of World War I and the disappointment that followed. Artists and thinkers involved with the movement rejected the rationality and materialism they believed had caused the war. Instead, they accepted chaos, absurdity, and spontaneity to express their discontent. The movement quickly spread to other cities, including Berlin, New York, and Paris, where it evolved into various forms of artistic expression, including visual arts, literature, theater, and music. This spread of Dadaist ideas across Europe and America marked a major change in the field of modern art.\n\nCentral to Dadaism was the idea of anti-art, which questioned what art truly is. Dadaists believed that traditional artistic techniques and subjects were not enough to convey the complexities of modern life. They used unconventional materials and methods, often creating works that were intentionally challenging or nonsensical. For example, Marcel Duchamp's \"Fountain,\" a urinal presented as art, showed this rejection of traditional artistic features. By elevating everyday objects to the status of art, Dadaists aimed to disrupt the established art world and provoke critical thought about creativity and artistic value. This extreme approach not only challenged the art community but also encouraged broader reflection on the nonsense of contemporary existence.\n\nThe Dada movement was characterized by its varied range of styles and techniques, reflecting the individual approaches of its artists. Collage, photomontage, and collection became popular methods for Dada artists, allowing them to mix different elements and create new meanings. Artists like Hannah Hch and Kurt Schwitters used these techniques to review modern society and explore themes of identity and gender. Hch's work, in particular, challenged traditional ideas of femininity and the role of women in society, making her an important figure within the movement. The use of chance and randomness in the creative process was also a characteristic of Dadaism, as artists sought to accept the unpredictable nature of life. This acceptance of randomness not only reflected the chaos of the world around them but also served as a metaphor for the uncertainty of life itself.\n\nEven though it seemed chaotic, Dadaism was deeply rooted in philosophical ideas. Influenced by the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud, Dadaists explored themes of irrationality, the unconscious, and the rejection of meaning. The movement's acceptance of nihilism and middle-class sentiment connected with the broader cultural shifts of the time, as many sought to break free from traditional values. Dadaists often used humor and irony as tools for review, employing satire to expose the nonsense of war, politics, and societal standards. Although this approach was revolutionary, it also sparked debates within the art community about the role of art in society. Some critics argued that Dadaism's rejection of meaning ultimately undermined the potential for art to inspire change, while others contended that its very absurdity was a powerful form of resistance.\n\nThe decline of Dadaism in the early 1920s coincided with the rise of Surrealism, which sought to build upon Dada's foundations while introducing a more structured approach to exploring the unconscious mind. Many former Dadaists, including Andr Breton, transitioned into the Surrealist movement, bringing with them the principles of spontaneity and absurdity. However, the legacy of Dadaism continued to influence later artistic movements, including Pop Art and Conceptual Art. The Dadaists' challenge to the status quo and their exploration of the boundaries of art paved the way for future generations of artists to question and redefine artistic expression. This ongoing discussion about the nature of art and its societal implications remains relevant today, as contemporary artists grapple with similar themes of identity, politics, and the role of technology in shaping culture.\n\nIn todays discussions, Dadaism remains an important reference point for conversations about the nature of art and its role in society. The movement's focus on anti-art and its critique of established norms connect with contemporary artists who continue to challenge conventions. Also, the Dadaists' exploration of chance and randomness has found new relevance in the digital age, where technology allows for the manipulation of images and ideas in unprecedented ways. As society deals with issues of identity, politics, and the impact of technology on culture, the spirit of Dadaism endures, reminding us of the importance of questioning and redefining the boundaries of artistic expression. Furthermore, the questions raised by Dadaism about creativity and the role of the artist in society continue to inspire new generations, suggesting that the movement's legacy is far from over.",

    "TITLE": "Corporate Governance",
    "PARAGRAPH": "Corporate management includes the systems, principles, and processes by which companies are directed and controlled. It involves the complex relationships among various parties involved, including shareholders, management, the board of directors, and other groups like employees and customers. The importance of corporate management has grown in recent decades, especially after a series of corporate scandals and financial crises that highlighted the need for openness, responsibility, and ethical behavior in business practices. Effective corporate management is not only important for the sustainability of individual companies but also for the overall stability and integrity of the economy.\n\nA main goal of corporate management is to align the interests of different parties involved. Shareholders usually want to maximize their returns on investment, while management may focus on operational efficiency and long-term growth. The board of directors plays an important role in balancing these interests, making sure that management acts in the best interests of shareholders while also considering the factors that affect other parties involved. This alignment is often helped by establishing clear policies and procedures for decision-making, risk management, and performance evaluation. However, the challenge remains in balancing these often competing interests, especially during economic uncertainty.\n\nThe structure of corporate management varies widely across different countries and regions, influenced by cultural, legal, and economic factors. In the United States, for example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted in response to corporate scandals like Enron and WorldCom, imposing stricter rules on financial reporting and corporate responsibility. In contrast, many European countries use a two-tier board system, separating the supervisory board from the management board to enhance oversight and reduce conflicts of interest. While these structures aim to improve management, they also raise questions about their effectiveness and adaptability in a more globalized business environment.\n\nDespite the existence of various management structures, challenges continue in ensuring effective corporate management. Issues like executive pay, board diversity, and shareholder activism have received more attention in recent years. For example, excessive executive compensation has raised concerns about the potential disagreement of interests between management and shareholders. Critics argue that high pay packages might encourage short-term decision-making at the expense of long-term value creation. Additionally, the lack of diversity on corporate boards has been linked to uniform thinking and a failure to adequately represent the interests of a broader range of parties involved. As a result, many companies are now focusing on diversity and inclusion projects as part of their management strategies, recognizing that varied perspectives can improve decision-making.\n\nThe rise of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards has further changed the landscape of corporate management. Investors are increasingly looking at ESG factors when making investment decisions, understanding that companies with strong management practices are more likely to achieve long-term viability and reduce risks. This shift has led corporations to adopt more comprehensive management structures that include ESG factors in their strategic planning and operations. For example, companies are now more frequently sharing information about their sustainability efforts and social impact projects, enhancing openness and responsibility to parties involved. This trend reflects changing investor preferences and highlights the growing recognition of corporate responsibility in todays business world.\n\nIn conclusion, corporate management remains a changing and developing field that is important to the success of modern corporations. As businesses navigate a more complex global landscape, the need for strong management structures that promote ethical behavior, responsibility, and stakeholder involvement is essential. While significant progress has been made in establishing management frameworks, ongoing challenges require continuous improvement and adaptation. The future of corporate management will likely be influenced by emerging trends, including technological advancements, changing societal expectations, and a greater focus on sustainability. So, it is crucial for corporations to stay alert and proactive in their management practices to build trust and resilience in an ever-changing environment. Furthermore, questions about the effectiveness of existing structures and the potential for new models of management remain open for exploration, inviting further inquiry into this vital aspect of modern business.",
